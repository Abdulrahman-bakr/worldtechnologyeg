# Architecture Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the World Technology Store application.

## Core Principles

- **Feature-Sliced Design:** Code is organized by business features rather than technical layers.
- **Component-Based:** The UI is built using a composition of reusable React components.
- **Centralized Logic:** Business logic is encapsulated within custom hooks for reusability and testability.
- **Scalability:** The structure is designed to be easily extensible with new features.
